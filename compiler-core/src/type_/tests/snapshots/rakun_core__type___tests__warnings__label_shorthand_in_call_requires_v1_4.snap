----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible rakun version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.rakun:6:10
  │
6 │   Wibble(wibble:)
  │          ^^^^^^^ This requires a Rakun version >= 1.4.0

The label shorthand syntax was introduced in version v1.4.0. But the Rakun
version range specified in your `rakun.toml` would allow this code to run
on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `rakun.toml` or update it to be:

    rakun = ">= 1.4.0"
