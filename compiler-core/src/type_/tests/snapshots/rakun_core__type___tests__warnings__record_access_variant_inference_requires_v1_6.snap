warning: Incompatible rakun version range

9 │     Wibble(..) -> wibble.b
  │                         ^^ This requires a Rakun version >= 1.6.0

Field access on custom types when the variant is known was introduced in
version v1.6.0. But the Rakun version range specified in your `rakun.toml`
would allow this code to run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting
in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `rakun.toml` or update it to be:

    rakun = ">= 1.6.0"
