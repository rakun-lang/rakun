----- WARNING
warning: Incompatible rakun version range
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.rakun:4:8
  │
4 │   _ if 1.0 /. 1.0 == 0.0 -> Nil
  │        ^^^^^^^^^^ This requires a Rakun version >= 1.3.0

Arithmetic operations in guards were introduced in version v1.3.0. But the
Rakun version range specified in your `rakun.toml` would allow this code to
run on an earlier version like v1.0.0, resulting in compilation errors!
Hint: Remove the version constraint from your `rakun.toml` or update it to be:

    rakun = ">= 1.3.0"
