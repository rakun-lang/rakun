pub fn main() {

----- WARNING
warning: Todo found
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.rakun:2:11

2 │           todo(1, Nil)
  │           ^^^^ This code is incomplete

This code will crash if it is run. Be sure to finish it before
running your program.

Hint: I think its type is `fn(Int, Nil) -> a`.


warning: Todo used as a function
  ┌─ /src/warning/wrn.rakun:2:16

  │                ^^^^^^

`todo` is not a function and will crash before it can do anything with
these arguments.

Hint: if you want to display an error message you should write
`todo as "my error message"`
